FROM 
    public."orders" o
JOIN 
    public."payment" p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY 
    year, month
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly order volume
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS monthly_order_volume
FROM 
    public."orders"
GROUP BY 
    year, month
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Combine monthly revenue and order volume
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) AS month,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM 
    public."orders" o
JOIN 
    public."payment" p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
GROUP BY 
    year, month
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Filter only 2024 orders
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) AS month,
    SUM(p.amount) AS revenue_2024,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders_2024
FROM 
    public."orders" o
JOIN 
    public."payment" p ON o.order_id = p.order_id
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) = 2024
GROUP BY 
    year, month
ORDER BY 
    month;
```
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 months by revenue
```sql
SELECT
